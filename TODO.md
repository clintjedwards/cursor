- Make the output of buildPlugin available in error message
- Flesh out RunPipeline now that it works
- We should clean up a build if the create fails
- Implement concurrent safe map for plugins and generating pipeline runs/or database these things..probably database
- Clean up a build if the create fails
- Tasks should be able to share children and that child should wait on both those tasks to complete successfully before moving on
- Tasks should support arguments
- Tasks should pass in some always availabile variables that would be useful to task creators, like which taskRunid is currently running
- Tasks should have some way to involve users manually. It would be cool for something to get to a state to wait for user interaction
- Tasks should be able to be executed on their lonesome. So I should be able to through the interface return a single task
- Check for cyclical graphs/ include check for if the root node even exits
- Check for any tasks that are in the map but are unable to be reached
- All these checks should fail the run and return a proper error so that that user can fix it
- Tasks should eventually properly show us logs
- Investigate using value passes instead of reference passes for ExecuteTask and friends
- Save plugins as they are added and reload them from the database on application startup
- CLI should use cool spinners because shutup
